🗳️ **Nationalratswahlen 2023 Simulation Sitzzuteilung Basel** 🇨🇭

#### 📋 Project Overview 📋

This tool simulates the seat allocation for the Nationalratswahlen 2023 in Basel, taking into account the list connections between political parties. Sub-lists are not listed individually but are counted towards their respective main party votes. For simplicity, the remaining isolated votes have been combined, even though they don't have list connections. The default values are based on the 2019 elections.
